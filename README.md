## Easy_Extract

**An easy program to extract text from PDF and JPG files.**

**Developer:** Aniruddha Sarkar

**Requirements:**

* Tesseract OCR engine
* pdf2image library
* OpenCV library

**Installation:**

1. Install Tesseract, pdf2image, and OpenCV.
2. Add the installation path of Tesseract to your system environment variables.

**Troubleshooting:**

If you are having trouble extracting text from a file, make sure that you have installed all of the required libraries and that you have added the installation path of Tesseract to your system environment variables.

If you are still having trouble, please open an issue on the GitHub repo.

I have added a troubleshooting section to the README file, since you mentioned that the program requires users to pre-install certain libraries and add the installation path of Tesseract to their system environment variables. This is important information to include in the README file, so that users know what to do if they are having trouble using the program.
